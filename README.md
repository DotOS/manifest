Downloading Source Code:
========================

To get started with the building dotOS for your device, you'll need to get familiar with [Git and Repo](http://source.android.com/source/using-repo.html).

To initialize your local repository, use a command like this:

```bash
repo init -u https://github.com/DotOS/manifest.git -b dot13.0
```

then to sync up:
================

```bash
repo sync
```

> To speed syncs, pass the -c (current branch) and -jthreadcount flags.
> Also to suppress output, pass the -q (quiet) flag.
